    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Prasoon Mishra, a passionate web developer currently pursuing
      my B.Tech in engineering. Ever since I wrote my first line of code, Iâ€™ve
      been fascinated by the endless possibilities of web development. My
      journey began with front-end technologies, and now Iâ€™m on a mission to
      become a full-stack developer, mastering both client-side and server-side
      development.
    </p>

    <h2>My Passion for Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      I love turning ideas into reality through clean, functional, and visually
      appealing web applications. From designing responsive user interfaces to
      optimizing performance, I enjoy every aspect of the development process. I
      believe that great websites are not just about aesthetics but also about
      usability, efficiency, and seamless user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>My Skills & Learning Path</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
      modern front-end frameworks. As I continue to grow, I am actively learning
      back-end technologies, databases, and deployment strategies to build
      robust and scalable web applications. My goal is to bridge the gap between
      front-end and back-end development, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user
      experience.
    </p>
